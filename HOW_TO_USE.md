## Tips & Tricks

### For Organizers:
- ✅ **Set a deadline** for joining (e.g., "Join by Dec 5th")
- ✅ **Remind people** to add wishlists
- ✅ **Test with small group** first if unsure
- ✅ **Draw names early** so people have time to shop
- ✅ **Set clear budget** to avoid awkward gift disparities

### For Participants:
- ✅ **Join quickly** so organizer can draw names
- ✅ **Make wishlist helpful** but not demanding
- ✅ **Save the group link** to check it later
- ✅ **Don't share** who you drew (that's the fun!)
- ✅ **Respect the budget** if one was set

### For Everyone:
- 🎯 **Budget**: Stick to it! Don't make others feel bad
- 📝 **Wishlists**: Be thoughtful but flexible
- 🤐 **Secrecy**: Don't hint or reveal before exchange
- 🎁 **Wrapping**: Even cheap gifts look great wrapped!
- 😊 **Have Fun**: It's about giving, not receiving!

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't see who I drew"
- Make sure names have been drawn (organizer needs to tap "Draw Names")
- Refresh the group screen
- Close and reopen the app

### "Draw Names button is disabled"
- Need at least 2 participants
- Make sure everyone has finished joining
- Check if names already drawn (only once per group)

### "Invalid group code"
- Double-check the number
- Ask organizer for a new link
- Make sure you're typing just numbers

### "I want to change my wishlist"
- Currently can't edit after joining
- Ask organizer to create new group
- Or just text your Secret Santa directly (defeats purpose though!)

### "Can I see everyone's assignments?"
- **No!** That's the point of Secret Santa
- Only the server knows the full list
- Even organizers can't see all assignments
